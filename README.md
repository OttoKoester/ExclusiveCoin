[Bootstrap Release Date 12-17-2018
Block #1795000](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17D9YmvSwijHhM68p6an94ZNsKbtwhcB6/view)

This link, it's to download the bootstrap file for fast synchronization with the Blockchain of EXCL Network.

The release date is from December 17, 2018.

Please, just copy the bootstrap file ( *bootstrap.dat* ) to the ExclusiveCoin Folder, than it will load fast as possible around Block 1795000

I will try maintain this up-to-date every 2 Weeks with new versions of Bootstrap. 

PS: Actually, it’s not possible to upload files here, more than 100 Mb, it require to use complex tools called Git LFS (Git Large File Storage). At this moment, I’m using Google Drive, but I will move this link to a public domain with explorer website.
